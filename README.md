# Short Coding Tasks

- (yes, _interviewee_ is an actual word, I googled it!)
- inform the interviewee **upfront** that he will have to solve a small coding task:
  - let him choose a programming language and IDE
  - kindly ask him to set his PC up for sharing his screen and solving the task
  - he should try to code, as if this example was part of his daily work

## What to look for

- able to solve the task in time?
- all given edge cases covered by tests?
- TDD or code first?
- structured working or creative chaos?
- structure of resulting code?
  - OOP not really mandatory for these small tasks
  - splitting into submethods where appropriate
  - good names for variables and methods
  - clean code and readability in general
  - take the conventions of the chosen language into account (e.g. snake_case vs. CamelCase)
- let interviewee point out possible improvements afterwards!
